1. Make sure the version will be right (for a new minor version that means that
   you should set the patch level to -1 so dcvs will bump it to 0)

2. Write ChangeLog entry.

3. make dist, check that it builds and installs correctly.

4. Commit (git commit -a), tag as Release_X_Y_Z (git tag -s Release_X_Y_Z) 
   and push (git push).

5. Make new tarball, sign (gpg -b) and upload dist tarball 
   (sftp larsl@dl.sv.nongnu.org:/releases/ll-plugins).

6. Update webpages (including changelog).

7. Announce on http://freshmeat.net and any relevant mailing lists (only
   do mailing lists for minor and major version bumps).
