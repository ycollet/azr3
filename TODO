Ideas to implement some time in the future in a galaxy far away:

[ ] Add an input port and mix the input with the organ before the distortion 
    and rotating speaker effects
[ ] Theme support (different PNG files, maybe different control positions 
    specified in a text file)
[ ] LV2 frontend

If anyone else feels like coding any of these and posting a patch in the tracker
at https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=ll-plugins, go ahead.
