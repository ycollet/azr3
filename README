This is an JACK port of AZR-3, originally a VST plugin written by 
Rumpelrausch TÃ¤ips. It is a tonewheel organ with drawbars, distortion and 
rotating speakers. It's all licensed under the GNU GPL version 2, see the file 
COPYING.

To install, run 
 
 ./configure

and then 

 make

and finally, as root

 make install

If you have AZR3_JACK_MIDI_INPUT and/or AZR3_JACK_AUDIO_OUTPUT set in your
environment the synth will try to autoconnect its MIDI input ports and
audio output ports to the JACK clients or ports named in those variables.
For example, if you do this:

  AZR3_JACK_MIDI_INPUT=system AZR3_JACK_AUDIO_OUTPUT=system azr3

then azr3 will connect its MIDI input port to the first MIDI output port
in the JACK client "system" and its audio output ports to the first and second
audio input ports in the client "system". You can also select individual ports,
like this:

  AZR3_JACK_MIDI_INPUT="system:My Keyboard" azr3

azr3 will then connect its MIDI input port to the MIDI output port
"system:My Keyboard".

Ports will never be autoconnected when azr3 is started by lashd as part of
a reloaded session.
